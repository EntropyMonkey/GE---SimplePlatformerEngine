Running a demo:

1) Go to the Release folder. Run the .exe file.

OR

2) Setup the project by 

A) installing SDL, SDL_image, openGL, and glm.

* SDL 1.2.15 needs to be downloaded at http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php. 
* Set an environment variable called "SDK_SDL".
* SDL_image is included in the source code.
* The used openGL files can be found in the zip folder in the Source folder, along with
  installation instructions
* Same as openGL for glm

B) compiling the project in either Release or Debug mode.

3) When running the demo, don't press any buttons until you see a dragon.
Otherwise it will crash.
When you see a dragon use the up/down arrow and space buttons. After the launch, press
the up/down arrow keys to get bigger and smaller. The game is over when you become too 
slow. You can become faster by becoming smaller. However when you are small, the other
bombs push you backwards easier and you lose.
